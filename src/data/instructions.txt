Welcome to Wheel of Fortune! Two players are required to play.

The game will feature three normal rounds and one final round. The player
with the most money at the end of these rounds will advance to the final round.

Each normal round will start with both players having $0. A random
phrase will be chosen, which is a noun, person, phrase, or place.
An example of a phrase is: "A PIECE OF CAKE". Note that phrases will
only contain uppercase characters and spaces.

The current player will spin the wheel. If it lands on "BROKE", the
player loses all their money and loses their turn.

If it lands on a dollar amount, they may guess 3 letters for the phrase.
All letters of the phrase that are the guessed letters will be uncovered. Each
uncovered letter will give the player [AMOUNT] * [UNCOVERED] dollars.

The current player can then guess the phrase. If they guess correctly,
the round ends and the player will gain $20,000.
If the contestant does not guess correctly, the turn goes over to
the other player, who will repeat the process.
After three rounds, the player with the most money will advance to the
final round.

In the final round, the player with the most money will spin the wheel ONCE.

The wheel will have all values multiplied by 100, and the "BROKE" segment will
be replaced by "WINNER", worth $1,000,000.

The player will be able to guess the phrase of this round. If they guess
correctly, they will gain the amount spun. Otherwise, they will not gain anything.

At the end of the finals, both players will have their score entered into
a scoreboard. The final winner is whoever has the most money.

This is the end of the instructions. Good luck!
